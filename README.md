# FreeCodeCamp
A repository for my FreeCodeCamp exercises 
Nothing to interesting here. I just got tired of doing the FCC exercises on the online edittor and decided to switch to writing them in VS Code and debug with Node. Once I did that, there was no reason not to save them and push them to github to have access to later.
